			Welcome to "DEY SEE ME ROLLIN'...", a dice game simulator. The idea here is that you use the input boxes in normal mode or addition mode to tell us what you want to roll. You will do this with an expression that will follow certain guidelines. In normal mode for simple cases (literal value, single die roll, multiple dice roll), you will get the odds for each outcome of your particular input back. For more complex cases (drop lowest rolls, keep highest rolls, explosive rolls) you have the option to wait a little longer to get those odds calculated (for not-too-massive cases) if you use the checkbox below. Here are some basic rules:
			<ul>
				<li><img ng-src="public/assets/diceLogo.png" class="miniDiceImage"> <b>Literal Value: </b> Enter a non-negative whole number <b>P</b> and you will get the same <b>P</b> back. E.g. 1 => 1, 0 => 0, etc.</li>
				<li><img ng-src="public/assets/diceLogo.png" class="miniDiceImage"> <b>Single Die Roll: </b> Enter "d" (lowercase!) followed a positive whole number <b>X</b> and you will roll one die with the same number of faces than the number you entered (<b>X</b>). E.g. d2 => like a coinflip (outcome is 1 or 2), d6 => like a cubic die roll (outcome is 1 to 6), etc.</li>
				<li><img ng-src="public/assets/diceLogo.png" class="miniDiceImage"> <b>Multiple Dice Roll: </b> Enter a positive whole number <b>N</b>, followed by "d" (lowercase!), followed a positive whole number <b>X</b> and you will roll <b>N</b> dice with <b>X</b> faces. Then all rolls are added to each other and this is returned. E.g. 3d2 => minimum 3, maximum 6, 2d6 => minimum 2, maximum 12, etc.</li>
				<li><img ng-src="public/assets/diceLogo.png" class="miniDiceImage"> <b>Drop Lowest Rolls: </b> Enter a positive whole number <b>N</b>, followed by "d" (lowercase!), followed a positive whole number <b>X</b>, followed by a "d" (lowercase!), followed by a non-negative whole number <b>D</b> (which must be <b>N - 1</b> at most), and you will roll <b>N</b> dice with <b>X</b> faces. The lowest <b>D</b> rolls are then discarded. All surviving rolls are added to each other and this is returned. E.g. 3d2d1 => minimum 2, maximum 4, 5d6d4 => minimum 1, maximum 6, etc.</li>
				<li><img ng-src="public/assets/diceLogo.png" class="miniDiceImage"> <b>Keep Highest Rolls: </b> Enter a positive whole number <b>N</b>, followed by "d" (lowercase!), followed a positive whole number <b>X</b>, followed by a "k" (lowercase!), followed by a positive whole number <b>K</b> (which must be <b>N</b> at most), and you will roll <b>N</b> dice with <b>X</b> faces. You only keep the highest <b>K</b> rolls, and the rest are then discarded. All surviving rolls are added to each other and this is returned. E.g. 3d2k1 => minimum 1, maximum 6, 5d6k4 => minimum 4, maximum 24, etc.</li>
				<li><img ng-src="public/assets/diceLogo.png" class="miniDiceImage"> <b>Explosive Rolls: </b> Enter a positive whole number <b>N</b>, followed by "d" (lowercase!), followed a positive whole number <b>X</b>, followed by an "x" (lowercase!), followed by a positive whole number <b>E</b> (which must be <b>X</b> at most, and greater than 1), and you will roll <b>N</b> dice with <b>X</b> faces. You add all the outcomes, and if a dice has an outcome that is equal or greater than <b>E</b>, this dice will be re-rolled, its new output added to the total, and check against <b>E</b> again in this manner. For example, say we enter 3d6x3 and get 1, 3, 4. 1 is lower than <b>E</b>, so no need to re-roll. 3 is equal to <b>E</b>, so we re-roll it and get 6, which is greater than <b>E</b>. We re-roll again and get 2, so we're done with that die. We then move on to 4, which is greater than <b>E</b>, so we re-roll it and get 1, so we stop. Thus, the outcome would be 1 + 3 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 17. </li>
			</ul>
			The game has two modes: normal and addition modes. Normal mode is largely described by the first paragraph and each type of input above. In addition mode, we do not see the odds of each expression, but rather we see a breakdown of each expression, and its outcome that can be added or subtracted to subsequent expressions. The best way to learn how to play is to begin playing! <br/><br/><br/>
